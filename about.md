**Barbarian Engineer** is the programming blog of [Matt Hucke](/author/matt).
It began in 2014 as a Ghost blog, but stagnated as Matt moved from Chicago to Seattle
in 2015.  In July 2017 the blog was "revivified", reborn using Jekyll and hosted on 
Github Pages.

All photographs are by Matt Hucke.

The theme is "Lens" by Adventure Themes, available [themeforest.net:(https://themeforest.net/item/lens-personal-or-multi-author-jekyll-blog/17457429)
