I'm **Matt Hucke**, a programmer and sysadmin in Seattle. 

I'm also a photographer; view my work at [MattHPhoto.com](http://matthphoto.com) and
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/matthucke).

Why "Barbarian Engineer"?  I've worked for small companies for most of my career,
as the sole programmer.  With no one else to rely on, I've had to survive on 
my own - like Conan, a wanderer on the fringes of civilization.
